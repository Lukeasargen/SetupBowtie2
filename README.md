# Setup the linux

## Pasting in a terminal

Pasting can be done by __right-clicking__ in the terminal. If that does not work you can add copy/paste to the linux terminal by editing the terminal properties.

Select _QuickEdit_ Mode and _Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste_. _QuickEdit_ allows for the right-click pasting trick.

__Ctrl+Shift+C__ and __Ctrl+Shift+V__ will also be copy and paste.

# Setup the project folders

# Install bowtie2

# Setup localmapper

1. Download the repo as zip, extract, and copy it to your project folder

![download_repo](/images/download_repo.png)

or clone the repo into your bowtie2 folder.

A short cut for opening a terminal at a folder is to __Shift+Right Click__ in the explorer window and click _Open Linux shell here_.

![open_shell_from_folder](/images/open_shell_from_folder.png)

Run `git clone https://github.com/DNAReplicationLab/localMapper.git` in your project directory.

Both methods result in a folder call `localmapper` in your porject folder and it will have identical contents to the repo.
