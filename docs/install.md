You now have an Ubuntu distribution install.

You can run it by pressing âŠž Windows key , typing "Ubuntu" , and running the Ubuntu App.

Extra info:

* The to linux filesystem can be found at a path similar to this : `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs`. You can use the File Explorer to view the contents here. You can copy from here (I have had no problems yet). __Do not add files or folders here with File Explorer.__ Use `cp` or `mv` to copy or move files to the the linux filesystem. Another way is to not move the files and to access the drives directly located at `mnt/<drive_letter>/`. For instance, the C drive is `mnt/c/`.
* You can uninstall by going to __Settings__ > __Apps__, finding Ubuntu and clicking __Uninstall__.

## Pasting in a terminal

Pasting can be done by __right-clicking__ in the terminal. If that does not work you can add copy/paste to the linux terminal by editing the terminal properties.

Select _QuickEdit_ Mode and _Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste_. _QuickEdit_ allows for the right-click pasting trick.

__Ctrl+Shift+C__ and __Ctrl+Shift+V__ will also be copy and paste.
